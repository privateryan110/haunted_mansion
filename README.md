# haunted_mansion
A 2D haunted mansion game. 

You are a character that is stuck in a haunted mansion trying to find treasure. 

How to play:
  Move around using WASD controls. 
  Left-click to shoot. You aim whereever your curser is. 
  Move over coins to collect them.
  Move over ammunition to collect more (you start with 6).

Enemies:
  1) Zombies
      These are the most straightforward enemy. They spawn on the edges of the map and move towards you, if one touches you, you die. You can kill them by shooting them.

  2) Ghosts
       These are more complicated. They spawn on the edge of the map and move towards you. You cannot shoot them. The only way to stop them is to stand completely still they pass through you. That includes aiming your gun or shooting.
       If you move while they are touching you, they kill you.

  3) Statues
       These busts are off of the map and thus cannot be killed or shot at. Their eyes track you. At a random time they will decided to shoot. They lock on to wear you. You have a tiny bit of time to move out of the way before you are caught in their beam.
       If you are within the radius of destruction from their beam you die.

     Scoring:
       Your score is determined by the number of coins you collect.

Play or Pause:
  The play or pause button appears at the edges of the screen depending on what mode you are already on. Pause to see your highscore, current score, and ammo counts. 

Difficulty:
  Select your difficulty using the slider before you start each new game. There are 3 diffulty modes, all the way on the left being the easiest and all the way on the right being the hardest. 
  Harder difficulties increases the odds each frame that zombies and ghosts spawn and the statues fire while decreasing the chance that ammo will spawn.

Images documenting the creation process can be found under the "documentation" folder. 

Have fun!
